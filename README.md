# FIRST_YEAR_MATLAB
These are the scripts from my first year at uni, for a complementary course of numerical analysis. Very small course, it was just to let us see how matlab could have been useful. It was a linear algebra course. I keep this as something I like to remember.
This has an emotional value for me, it was my first time approaching the technical computing. It was my first ever time. The first coding experience I had was with C and Matlab!
